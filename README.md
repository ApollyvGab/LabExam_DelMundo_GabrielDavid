I created an online repository at github and cloned it to my device htdocs folder.
I then started to follow the steps on the word file.
I created an index file to insert my code for the log in form, then I committed it.
I then created a css file to put designs on my login form, then committed it.
After that, I creared a js file to have a validation for my credentials on the log in form, then I committed it.
Then I created a homepage for where the code will take me after successfully logging in, and I added a design to it on my css file, then committed it. 
Then I created a branch to create a nav bar on the homepage, then committed it. 
and then I pushed it. And now I am creating this documentation.
